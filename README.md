# rem

macOS Reminders CLI with native assignment, list sections, natural language dates, and import/export — all in one binary. This is the [felixfoertsch fork](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/rem) of [BRO3886/rem](https://github.com/BRO3886/rem).

**[Builds and installation](docs/builds.md)** | **[Collaboration](docs/collaboration.md)** | **[Permissions](docs/troubleshooting.md)** | **[Command reference](skills/rem-cli/references/commands.md)**

`main` is experimental. Assignment and section writes are enabled by default, without `--experimental`; native permission, identity, save, and readback checks remain enforced. Local readback does not prove iCloud synchronization or notifications.

## Features

- **Sub-200ms reads AND writes** — EventKit via cgo (go-eventkit), direct memory access, no IPC
- **Single binary** — EventKit compiled in via cgo, no helper processes
- **Natural language dates** — `tomorrow`, `next friday at 2pm`, `in 3 hours`, `eod`
- **Reminder commands** — full CRUD, search, stats, overdue, upcoming, interactive mode
- **Assignments** — list participants, assign to an existing participant or `me`, clear assignment, and inspect availability-aware metadata
- **Sections** — list, create, and rename native sections; membership/move/filter/delete are not implemented
- **Permission diagnostics** — `rem doctor` without requesting Reminders access
- **Multiple output formats** — table, JSON, plain text
- **Native tags** — `#hashtag` in titles or `--tags` flag, stored as real Reminders.app tags
- **Location reminders** — geofence triggers via `--location "lat,lng"`, fire on arrival or departure
- **Shared list support** — full CRUD on shared lists, sharing state in `rem lists`, and moves across the shared-list boundary via copy (macOS has no true move there)
- **Import/Export** — JSON and CSV with tags and location triggers; JSON exports assignment metadata, but imports do not replay list-scoped assignments
- **Powered by [go-eventkit](go-eventkit/README.md)** — use the same library directly for programmatic Go access
- **Shell completions** — bash, zsh, fish

## Installation

### Download a main build

Download `rem-macos-<full-commit-sha>` from a successful [Build binaries run](https://github.com/felixfoertsch/rem/actions/workflows/build.yml). GitHub sign-in is required. Each artifact includes Apple Silicon and Intel archives plus SHA-256 checksums. Follow [download, verification, and installation instructions](docs/builds.md).

Artifacts are built for every new main commit and retained for 90 days. These snapshots are not Developer ID signed or notarized. Releases and tags remain manual; there is no moving latest-release installer.

### Build from source

Use the Go version required by `go.mod` and Xcode Command Line Tools for cgo/framework headers.

```fish
git clone https://github.com/felixfoertsch/rem.git
cd rem
make build
./bin/rem version
```

Binary: `bin/rem`. Both Go modules are maintained here; build this checkout to include the local library.

## Bundled EventKit library

`go-eventkit/` is maintained here as a self-contained Go module, including its MIT license and tests. Root `go.mod` resolves `github.com/felixfoertsch/rem/go-eventkit` locally; normal clones include everything without submodule setup. No upstream compatibility or synchronization requirement applies. See [source provenance](go-eventkit/UPSTREAM.md).

`make test` and `make lint` check both modules. To work on the library alone, run Go commands from `go-eventkit/`. Root `go test ./...` does not traverse nested modules. Native collaboration lives in `go-eventkit/reminderkit/`; `internal/reminderkit/` only resolves CLI participant selectors and orchestrates assignment.

## Requirements

- macOS 13+ for core EventKit support; collaboration uses runtime-guarded private ReminderKit APIs and needs account-specific validation
- Xcode Command Line Tools (for building from source — cgo/clang + framework headers)
- Data commands need Reminders permission for their responsible host application; help/version/doctor do not request access. See [permission troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
# List all reminder lists
rem lists --count

# Create a reminder with an alarm
rem add "Buy groceries" --list Personal --due tomorrow --priority high --remind-me 15m

# Create with tags (parsed from title + --tags flag)
rem add "Review PR #work #urgent" --tags "deploy"

# Location reminder: fires when arriving (default) or leaving
rem add "Buy milk" --location "37.3318,-122.0312" --radius 200
rem add "Take out trash" --location "37.3318,-122.0312" --on-leave

# List incomplete reminders
rem list --list Work --incomplete

# Search reminders
rem search "meeting"

# Show reminder details
rem show <id>

# Complete a reminder
rem complete <id>

# Show statistics
rem stats
```

## Commands

### Reminders

```bash
# Create
rem add "Title" [--list LIST] [--due DATE] [--priority high|medium|low] [--notes TEXT] [--url URL] [-F/--flagged] [-t/--tags TAGS] [-r/--remind-me DURATION] [--repeat PATTERN] [--location "LAT,LNG"] [--radius METERS] [--on-arrive|--on-leave]
rem add -i                          # Interactive creation

# List
rem list [--list LIST] [--incomplete] [--completed] [--flagged] [--due-before DATE] [--due-after DATE] [-o json|table|plain]
rem ls                              # Alias

# Show
rem show <id>                       # Full or partial ID
rem get <id> -o json

# Update
rem update <id> [-t/--title TEXT] [--due DATE] [--priority LEVEL] [--notes TEXT] [--url URL] [--add-tags TAGS] [--remove-tags TAGS] [-r/--remind-me DURATION] [--repeat PATTERN] [--list LIST] [--location "LAT,LNG"|none] [--radius METERS] [--on-arrive|--on-leave]

# Complete / Uncomplete (support multiple IDs)
rem complete <id> [id2 id3...]
rem done <id>                       # Alias
rem uncomplete <id> [id2 id3...]

# Flag / Unflag (support multiple IDs)
rem flag <id> [id2 id3...]
rem unflag <id> [id2 id3...]

# Delete (supports multiple IDs)
rem delete <id> [id2 id3...]        # Asks for confirmation
rem rm <id> --force                 # Skip confirmation (-f / --yes / -y also work)

# Today — due and overdue reminders
rem today
```

### Lists

```bash
# View all lists
rem lists
rem lists --count                   # Show reminder counts

# Create a list
rem list-mgmt create "My List"
rem lm new "Shopping"               # Alias

# Rename a list
rem list-mgmt rename "Old Name" "New Name"

# Delete a list
rem list-mgmt delete "Name"         # Asks for confirmation
rem lm rm "Name" --force
```

### Assignments, sections, and diagnostics

```fish
rem participants --list "Family" -o json
rem assign <id> me -o json
rem show <id> -o json
rem assign <id> --none -o json
rem sections --list "Family" -o json
rem section create "Planning" --list "Family"
rem section rename "Planning" "Next" --list "Family"
rem doctor
```

Assignment uses exact participant identity, never invitations or sharing changes. A null assignee means unassigned only when `assignment_available` is true. Writes validate a fresh native readback; verification failure after a save does not imply rollback. Shared-list moves and imports do not preserve assignment. See [collaboration contracts and live validation limits](docs/collaboration.md).

### Search & Analytics

```bash
rem search "query" [--list LIST] [--incomplete]
rem stats                           # Overall statistics
rem overdue                         # Overdue reminders
rem upcoming [--days 7]             # Upcoming due dates
```

### Import / Export

```bash
# Export
rem export --list Work --format json > work.json
rem export --format csv --output-file reminders.csv
rem export --incomplete --format json

# Import
rem import work.json
rem import reminders.csv --list "Imported"
rem import --dry-run data.json      # Preview without creating
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
rem interactive                     # Full interactive menu
rem i                               # Alias
rem add -i                          # Interactive add
```

### Output Formats

All list/show commands support `--output` (`-o`):

```bash
rem list -o table                   # Default, formatted table
rem list -o json                    # Machine-readable JSON
rem list -o plain                   # Simple text
rem list -o json | jq '.[].name'   # Pipe to jq
```

Color output respects `NO_COLOR`:
```bash
NO_COLOR=1 rem list
rem list --no-color
```

### AI Agent Skills

```bash
rem skills install                          # Interactive picker (shows confirmation prompt)
rem skills install --agent claude           # Claude Code only
rem skills install --agent all             # All supported agents
rem skills install --dry-run              # Preview files without writing
rem skills status                          # Check installation status
rem skills uninstall                       # Remove the skill
```

### Shell Completions

```bash
# Bash
rem completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/rem

# Zsh
rem completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_rem"

# Fish
rem completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/rem.fish
```

## Date Parsing

Date parsing is powered by [`go-eventkit/dateparser`](go-eventkit/README.md):

| Input | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `now` | Current date and time |
| `today` | Today at 9:00 AM |
| `tomorrow` | Tomorrow at 9:00 AM |
| `next monday` | Next Monday at 9:00 AM |
| `monday 2pm` | Next Monday at 2:00 PM |
| `next friday at 2pm` | Next Friday at 2:00 PM |
| `in 2 days` | 2 days from now |
| `in 3 hours` | 3 hours from now |
| `5 days ago` | 5 days before now |
| `eod` / `end of day` | Today at 5:00 PM |
| `this week` | End of current week |
| `next week` | Next Monday at 9:00 AM |
| `next month` | 1st of next month at 9:00 AM |
| `mar 15` | March 15 at 9:00 AM |
| `5pm` | Today (or tomorrow) at 5:00 PM |
| `today 5pm` | Today at 5:00 PM |
| `2026-02-15` | February 15, 2026 |
| `2026-02-15 14:30` | February 15, 2026 at 2:30 PM |

## Go API

rem is powered by [**go-eventkit**](go-eventkit/README.md) — use it directly for programmatic access to macOS Reminders in your own Go programs:

The library is part of this checkout and uses its own module. External local consumers can use a `replace` directive pointing to this checkout's `go-eventkit/` directory; no separate library release is published.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"

    "github.com/felixfoertsch/rem/go-eventkit/reminders"
)

func main() {
    client, err := reminders.New()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    // Create a reminder
    due := time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour)
    r, err := client.CreateReminder(reminders.CreateReminderInput{
        Title:    "Buy groceries",
        ListName: "Personal",
        DueDate:  &due,
        Priority: reminders.PriorityHigh,
    })
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fmt.Println("Created:", r.ID)

    // List incomplete reminders
    items, _ := client.Reminders(
        reminders.WithList("Personal"),
        reminders.WithCompleted(false),
    )
    for _, item := range items {
        fmt.Printf("- %s (due: %v)\n", item.Title, item.DueDate)
    }

    // Complete a reminder
    client.CompleteReminder(r.ID)

    // Get all lists
    lists, _ := client.Lists()
    for _, l := range lists {
        fmt.Printf("%s (%d reminders)\n", l.Title, l.Count)
    }
}
```

See the [go-eventkit README](go-eventkit/README.md) for the full API reference.

```

**Core reads and writes** — including reminder CRUD and list CRUD — go through `go-eventkit` (`github.com/felixfoertsch/rem/go-eventkit`) — an Objective-C EventKit bridge compiled into the binary via cgo. Direct in-process access to the Reminders store, no IPC. Assignments, participants, sections, and diagnostics use the bundled library's `go-eventkit/reminderkit` package. Runtime latency depends on the host and account.

**Flagged, tag, and list-sharing operations** use the private ReminderKit bridge in go-eventkit — EventKit doesn't expose these properties, but `REMReminder.flagged`, `REMReminder.hashtags`, and `REMList.isShared` do. Tags degrade gracefully if the private API becomes unavailable. Default-list selection uses EventKit; no AppleScript runtime is needed.

**Shared lists** work like any other list for creates, reads, updates, flags, tags, and deletes. Moving a reminder across a shared-list boundary is the one exception: macOS refuses a true move there (even Apple's own apps copy and delete behind the scenes), so rem does the same — the reminder is copied to the target with all fields intact, the original is deleted, and a warning with the new ID is printed to stderr.

## Performance

Tested with 224 reminders across 12 lists:

| Command | Time |
|---------|------|
| `rem lists` | 0.12s |
| `rem list` (all 224) | 0.13s |
| `rem show` (by prefix) | 0.11s |
| `rem search` | 0.11s |
| `rem stats` | 0.17s |

These inherited upstream measurements are not latency guarantees for this fork or its collaboration bridge. Measure the actual host/account when performance matters.

## Known Limitations

- **macOS only** — requires EventKit framework and osascript
- **No subtasks** — not exposed via EventKit
- **Tags, flagged, and list-sharing state use private API** — reads/writes go through Apple's private ReminderKit framework since EventKit doesn't expose these properties. If Apple changes the private API in a future macOS version, tags and flagged degrade gracefully (the reminder is still created/updated, a warning is printed — see [#44](https://github.com/BRO3886/rem/issues/44)) and lists simply report as unshared
- **No true move across shared-list boundaries** — macOS refuses it at the account level, so rem moves to/from shared lists by copy + delete; the reminder gets a new ID (warned on stderr). See [#50](https://github.com/BRO3886/rem/issues/50)
- **Immutable lists** cannot be renamed or deleted (system lists like Siri suggestions)
